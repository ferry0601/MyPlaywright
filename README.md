# Playwright Automation Testing – Tutorial Project

## 📌 Description
This repository contains my **Playwright automation testing practice** based on an online tutorial.

The main goal of this project is to learn:
- End-to-End (E2E) testing
- API testing
- UI automation
using **Playwright with JavaScript**.

> ⚠️ This is a learning project based on a tutorial, not a production-ready application.
